## Main Functionalities
A bot to help you organize your day and remove procrastination. On some days, we'll not feel like doing anything. So this basically helps us to talk to the bot as a
friend and which leads to ato-do list where we can input our tasks to be done and our free time. This automatically schedules the tasks giving each task a given amount of time. This can be converted to a pdf and downloaded.
