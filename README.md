## Abstract
A bot to help you organize your day and remove procrastination. On some days, we'll not feel like doing anything. So this basically helps us to talk to the bot as a
friend and which leads to ato-do list where we can input our tasks to be done and our free time. This automatically schedules the tasks giving each task a given amount of time. This can be converted to a pdf and downloaded.


## Future plan
● We are planning to convert this to app
● Connects to the fitness tracking app to track the time
● Sentiment Analysis to understand the mood of the user and respond accordingly
● TIMER to keep track of the time in which the given task has to be done
● Automatic question generator based on the website link attached
● Attractive notification system in such a way that the user doesn’t miss out and with
  beautiful graphics showing the output of the particular task.
● TIMER with a rewards system
